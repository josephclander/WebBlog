If you are learning to code too and would like to follow as I track my journey through my coding experience, please visit my blog. I will highlight the coding resources that I use and the problems that I face when trying to learn from them. Initially, I am working on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to be able to build websites and learn to become a Full-stack developer. This website will allow me to practice my coding skills and to update it as I learn new practices. If you are considering becoming a web developer or are already learning, follow my blog to see where I struggle, what tips I pick up and the issues facing someone starting to learn to code.">

						<h3>Changing how I consider success</h3>

						<p>During this week I managed to complete another module of the JavaScript section of the <a href="https://learn.co/tracks/bootcamp-prep">Flatiron School Bootcamp Prep</a>. Whilst a lot of the material is straight forward with a few examples, there are parts of JavaScript that took me a while to comprehend. Namely, "callbacks".</p>
						<p>After reading the material on the website, there were links for further resources and I found myself falling down a wormhole, as one article led to a little more understanding, followed by further mystery. As it turned out, the coding challenges didn't require callbacks but with over 3 hours of study on them, I was putting them in!</p>
						<p>For a second time I found myself completing a challenge at a reasonable pace until one part left me clueless. Now, the challenge worked in my browser, but I've already seen enough memes to know that it doesn't mean it works in the way it's supposed to and I didn't want to be that guy. After an extra hour on the help forum, I find out that to pass the written tests, all sections had to be within a given function and a 3s cut and paste job let it pass. one part of me was still fuming but I'm beginning to teach myself how to measure success.</p>
						<p>The journey helped me learn that I cannot check one array against another with just the "===" operator. Reading questions more carefully for technical details is essential and by talking with technical support, realised that I've learned more and at the same time realised that there is yet more again added to the list of things I need to learn.</p>

						<p>So after a full day of working one section at a time I have successfully managed to get the website ready for hosting. I had to show a lot of restraint to not start fire fighting as I saw other sections of my website out of line while I was progressing. The footer had not been touched since the start and at one point sat up above the header but I saw features through to a reasonable close that would only need fine touches.</p>
						<p>I am sure I will update this site and could go back to refactor it but it will be a decent enough layout to help me track my progression.</p>

						<p>Since my last post I have mainly been trying to figure out how to structure content for my <a href="http://whatcanicookwiththat.com/" target="_blank">whatcanicookwiththat.com</a> website. I'm finding it hard to be able to create something that looks good before I add code. I had a general idea that I wanted to create a splash page but was unsure how this would take shape after. After I spent the best part of an hour trying to take photos of the inside of my fridge from different angles, I settled on a few choice photos so that I could work for desktop and eventually, mobile. The general shape was quick but then came hours of shifting until I came up with the idea of the text coming in the form of a mobile phone conversation. I found that when I had the plan, it was a lot simpler to be able to break up the idea into sections and construct it. Yes there were errors but I knew where to head.</p>
						<p>I have created a minimum product that I am happy with but knew I needed to create content for further pages other wise it lacked real content and may cause confusion if I make it live. This is where I have had to stop for now.</p>
						<p>Now to work on this blog page. As it stands we have a scrolling background (with ugly blue leather photo of low quality) and a better looking header than I started with. That's it for now. Trying to force myself to tackle one feature at a time before commiting it to Git. Hard but I'm sure it'll pay off in the long run. Also learned that inset box-shadow does not work on images.</p>

						<h3>Two New Websites</h3>

						<p>A lot has gone through my mind with how to continue to learn to code and in what direction to go. I have now completed a lot of online courses that hold your hand through projects but I feel unsatisfied that I don't have the experience of building those things myself from the blank screen.</p>
						<p>Currently I am completing the FlatIron School's bootcamp prep course and it has covered a lot of material I have seen before but has been a good reminder, having had almost 2 years away from seriously attempting javascript. Another good reminder was the MIMO app for iPhone. Coding on a phone isn't really a thing but they manage to run through tutorials that are helpful.</p>
						<p>This all brought me to the conclusion that I needed to experience making something from scratch again so have opened two sites; <a href="https://www.josephclander.com/" target="_blank">www.josephclander.com</a> and <a href="http://whatcanicookwiththat.com/" target="_blank">www.whatcanicookwiththat.com</a>. I can continue to write about my progress and keep a place for the things that I make. Also in my spare time I love to cook and often talk about it on my instagram feed. I'm doing it so much now though that I feel I can make a dedicated channel to it with the tag name #whatcanicookwiththat where I show how to make meals from the last few remanants you find in the bottom of your fridge.</p>
						<p>I've aquired the sites and domains and am now working through the research for how I want these sites to look.</p>

						<p>A heavy day sorting out the house today but got some passive learning in. Watch videos on youtube from DevTips.</p>
						<p>Catching some more experience seeing how people use SASS to style their HTML and then caught up on more alignment tricks using flexbox. I know that just watching this, isn't going to make it stick in my mind permanently but at least it may remind me of the possibilities and know what I need to look up when I'm stuck on this stuff.</p>
