						<p>This is the first post in a mock up made to record the things that I pick up along the way.</p>
						<p>Today is trying to build another site from the blank screen and interact and map progress with Git and GitHub. After a number of tutorials on using git in the terminal, I think that I am now brave enough to give it a go.</p>

						<p>A heavy day sorting out the house today but got some passive learning in. Watch videos on youtube from DevTips.</p>
						<p>Catching some more experience seeing how people use SASS to style their HTML and then caught up on more alignment tricks using flexbox. I know that just watching this, isn't going to make it stick in my mind permanently but at least it may remind me of the possibilities and know what I need to look up when I'm stuck on this stuff.</p>

						<h3 class="article-title">Two New Websites</h3>
						<img class="post-photo" src="Images/newSite.png" alt="screen shot of new profile site">
						<p>A lot has gone through my mind with how to continue to learn to code and in what direction to go. I have now completed a lot of online courses that hold your hand through projects but I feel unsatisfied that I don't have the experience of building those things myself from the blank screen.</p>
						<p>Currently I am completing the FlatIron School's bootcamp prep course and it has covered a lot of material I have seen before but has been a good reminder, having had almost 2 years away from seriously attempting javascript. Another good reminder was the MIMO app for iPhone. Coding on a phone isn't really a thing but they manage to run through tutorials that are helpful.</p>
						<p>This all brought me to the conclusion that I needed to experience making something from scratch again so have opened two sites; <a href="josephclander.com">www.josephclander.com</a> and <a href="whatcanicookwiththat.com">www.whatcanicookwiththat.com</a>. I can continue to write about my progress and keep a place for the things that I make. Also in my spare time I love to cook and often talk about it on my instagram feed. I'm doing it so much now though that I feel I can make a dedicated channel to it with the tag name #whatcanicookwiththat where I show how to make meals from the last few remanants you find in the bottom of your fridge.</p>
						<p>I've aquired the sites and domains and am now working through the research for how I want these sites to look.</p>
