						<p>This is the first post in a mock up made to record the things that I pick up along the way.</p>
						<p>Today is trying to build another site from the blank screen and interact and map progress with Git and GitHub. After a number of tutorials on using git in the terminal, I think that I am now brave enough to give it a go.</p>

						<p>A heavy day sorting out the house today but got some passive learning in. Watch videos on youtube from DevTips.</p>
						<p>Catching some more experience seeing how people use SASS to style their HTML and then caught up on more alignment tricks using flexbox. I know that just watching this, isn't going to make it stick in my mind permanently but at least it may remind me of the possibilities and know what I need to look up when I'm stuck on this stuff.</p>

						<p>A lot has gone through my mind with how to continue to learn to code and in what direction to go. I have now completed a lot of online courses that hold your hand through projects but I feel unsatisfied that I don't have the experience of building those things myself from the blank screen.</p>
						<p>Currently I am completing the FlatIron School's bootcamp prep course and it has covered a lot of material I have seen before but has been a good reminder, having had almost 2 years away from seriously attempting javascript. Another good reminder was the MIMO app for iPhone. Coding on a phone isn't really a thing but they manage to run through tutorials that are helpful.</p>
						<p>This all brought me to the conclusion that I needed to experience making something from scratch again so have opened two sites; <a href="https://www.josephclander.com/">www.josephclander.com</a> and <a href="http://whatcanicookwiththat.com/">www.whatcanicookwiththat.com</a>. I can continue to write about my progress and keep a place for the things that I make. Also in my spare time I love to cook and often talk about it on my instagram feed. I'm doing it so much now though that I feel I can make a dedicated channel to it with the tag name #whatcanicookwiththat where I show how to make meals from the last few remanants you find in the bottom of your fridge.</p>
						<p>I've aquired the sites and domains and am now working through the research for how I want these sites to look.</p>

						<p>Since my last post I have mainly been trying to figure out how to structure content for my <a href="http://whatcanicookwiththat.com/">whatcanicookwiththat.com</a> website. I'm finding it hard to be able to create something that looks good before I add code. I had a general idea that I wanted to create a splash page but was unsure how this would take shape after. After I spent the best part of an hour trying to take photos of the inside of my fridge from different angles, I settled on a few choice photos so that I could work for desktop and eventually, mobile. The general shape was quick but then came hours of shifting until I came up with the idea of the text coming in the form of a mobile phone conversation. I found that when I had the plan, it was a lot simpler to be able to break up the idea into sections and construct it. Yes there were errors but I knew where to head.</p>
						<p>I have created a minimum product that I am happy with but knew I needed to create content for further pages other wise it lacked real content and may cause confusion if I make it live. This is where I have had to stop for now.</p>
						<p>Now to work on this blog page. As it stands we have a scrolling background (with ugly blue leather photo of low quality) and a better looking header than I started with. That's it for now. Trying to force myself to tackle one feature at a time before commiting it to Git. Hard but I'm sure it'll pay off in the long run. Also learned that inset box-shadow does not work on images.</p>
