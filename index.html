						<h3>Git branch and website update</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="article clearfix">
						<img class="post-photo" src="Images/filter.jpg" alt="snapshot of the newly added article topic filter">
						<p>Having completed a large section of the JavaScript	challenges on Free Code Camp, I decided it was time to start putting some into practice. As the amount of articles has grown on my site, I figured that it could do with a filter for the different topics. I could add another page but I felt that would really only be a copy and paste job of the first page so wouldn’t really be that challenging.</p>

						<p>As I had implemented jQuery to be able to minimize articles to a uniform size, I would be able to use this alongside vanilla JavaScript as well. I broke the problem down into stages. What would I need to see on the screen and what would be the logical steps for that to happen? </p>

						<p>This also gave me an opportunity to practice using Git branch. I set up one called “siteFilter” and set about updating the site in sections making sure I had a complete running code before each commit.</p>

						<p>Here are my commits with brief explanations. They have all since been merged into the master branch:</p>

						<p><strong>1. Basic links for filtering added and styled by adding additional scss partials</strong></p>

						<p>I decided what the categories would be. I already had some links set up so I utilized them for the time being and would go back to improve the design once the functionality was up and running. </p>

						<p><strong>2. js for active link completed</strong></p>

						<p>Now whichever link you click on will pick up the “.active” styling and it will be removed from all the others</p>

						<p><strong>3. Basic use of filter javascript has been enabled for desktop - if fewer than 2 articles, footer not against the bottom of the page</strong></p>

						<p>My site will now filter the articles but has created an issue with the footer</p>

						<p><strong>4. links made to buttons and removed for mobile screens</strong></p>

						<p>I updated the design and made sure it was not an issue for mobile screens. This is something I can try to include at a later stage.</p>

						<p><strong>5. reveal button for filter tags added, styled, mediaqueries adjusted</strong></p>

						<p>As the buttons took up space horizontally in the header, it looked untidy if it was not in use. I created a button to toggle between revealing these.</p>

						<p><strong>6. footer changed to fixed for all but mobile screens - this is to fix the issue with dynamic content from tags effecting placement</strong></p>

						<p>I’m sad to say that I was experimenting with different setups for the footer but was unable to find a way to create a sticky footer. One that would stick to the bottom if the content was not long enough to fit the height of the window. As my site would dynamically update, I couldn’t see a way to get it to work with plain CSS. At this stage I did not want to venture into long js code to measure the height of articles and windows and also realized that in fact, maybe the links in my footer would also be better if you could access them more readily.</p>

						<p><strong>Issues:</strong> </p>

						<p>Accessing the elements I needed.
						Most of my time was spent trying to see how to access my elements in the fashion that I had set them up. My “a” links were inside list tags and this caused issue with precedence overriding my rules.</p>

						<p>jQuery toggle() for a links.
							As links are display as list-item this ruined my design. This meant I had to experiment to find how to access the tags and then change style of each in my array.</p>

						<h3>Completed - FCC Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="article clearfix">
						<img class="post-photo" src="Images/fcc_jscert.jpg" alt="Screen Shot of certificate from free code camp">
						<p>It’s done. It’s done. I made it. I have now completed and passed tests for the 5 projects that award certification for FCC Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures. Some of the tasks were easier than others. However, I have always made a point of completing a task, passing the tests, and then researching to see how others completed it. This has helped tremendously through the earlier tasks FCC set and enabled me to have a better understanding of what makes better code. Some of your code may pass but is unnecessarily long, solved by brute force, has other bugs or is just not as elegant and readable as it could be.</p>

						<p>The tasks have been great (albeit frustrating at times) at highlighting areas that you still need to work on. It hasn’t been huge structural issues necessarily but highlighting that I may still only have a surface understanding of some of the finer points. For example, I passed almost all of the tests on the last challenge and only had to go back and adapt to fit a particular edge use case. This turned into 90% of my workload. The first thing I overlooked was initializing a variable as a constant, then latter wishing to change it to fit my edge case, and not immediately thinking this was something to look at. So var, let, const need to be part of my thought process in error checking. Finer parts of regex slowed me down too and I feel this is something that I will find myself needing to check references for whenever completing a tricky project. Some of the tasks made me consider the number of calculations the code may take and begin to research more on the big O. I was writing off for and while loops as more tasks were pushing to use higher order functions like .map, .filter and .reduce but found in some instances like the palindrome checker that they could lead to more efficient code, reducing calculations.</p>

						<p>Well now I am done there are decisions to be made. I have a paid front end course to complete on <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">teamtreehouse.com/</a> but also want to get back up to speed with other front end libraries they taught (and I haven’t touched for a while) such as Sass and jQuery which are available in the next FCC course. Also there’s a lot more reading to be done on algorithms I feel. It would be good to keep this going at a steady increment so that I can take it all in.</p>

						<h3>Reading - Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="article clearfix">
						<img class="post-photo" src="Images/data.jpg" alt="Text book front cover">
						<p>So I am now through the FCC Intermediate Challenges unharmed and more informed than when I started. Before diving headlong into the final projects I thought it was time to do some more advanced reading, especially since having completed lots of practical challenges, I would have more chance of understanding the theory in context.</p>

						<p>I was looking at the FCC reading list for javascript and came across the book “Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript” by Michael McMillan. Now that I have a lot of practice under my belt and am pretty familiar with the syntax of programming in javascript, I thought this book would be good to show me best practices. It would be an opportunity to write smarter, cleaner code. The initial chapter seemed fairly straight forward, then we moved from my very familiar use of arrays to linked lists.</p>

						<p>Having climbed a mountain, no lets say having climbed a steep hill, getting through the challenges and being close to receiving a certificate from FCC in javascript, starting to look at the data structures confused me. I suddenly felt that I was at the bottom of another steep hill, feeling as if I hadn’t even started climbing yet. The problem I’m currently having, isn’t that the setup of these data structures is too taxing, but that I can’t yet see why you would use them. Every challenge set so far has not required any other set up other than use of an array or reference to an object. Why would it be preferable to effectively build my own data system and methods and functions, when there are already ones available? Without this context currently, it feels as if we are trying to reinvent the wheel. </p>

						<p>Trying to read around the subject to make myself feel better, I belong to the mailing list of “Learn to code with me” and received a much lighter version to get me started <a href="https://learntocodewith.me/posts/data-structures/">learntocodewith.me/posts/data-structures/</a>.</p>

						<p>This work will be ongoing and I hope to learn uses and applications as well as the how.</p>

						<p>I am pausing here. Just for a moment. I have now worked through the lessons on Object and Function orientated programming and am standing before the intermediate challenges. After I complete these challenges, I can see the projects in the background to complete the certification. It will be a lot of work and am slightly nervous as to how I will cope with what I expect will be longer, more intricate issues.</p>

						<p>This course has now reinforced the ideas behind non-destructive functions that I covered in the Flatiron School’s bootcamp program and I feel better for it. Hopefully I am ready for these. See you in a while…</p>

						<h3>Completing FCC Basic js Challenges</h3>

						<img class="post-photo" src="Images/js_Basic_challenges.jpg" alt="page with coding challenges">
						<p>OK as setting up in the states is taking longer than expected and on top of that, the challenges of writing in javascript are getting tougher, my posts are getting further and further apart. However, today I hit another milestone as I finally completed all 16 of the <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting">freecodecamp basic js challenges</a>. I have had some challenges from other sites but not this many in a row.</p>

						<p>Again by taking these challenges on, I am more and more beginning to be able to tackle challenges in a systematic, progressive way. I am finding that the more time I spend at the start considering what the logical steps should be, the easier writing the code is. With experience I am more aware of what methods are available and so put them to use more quickly.</p>

						<p>It is interesting to see that there are many ways to solve problems and often with a little more thought, you’ll find there is an annoyingly simple approach. Yes, you’ll find you still need to use loops a lot of the time but the brute force methods of trying every value, in every single problem, can cause confusion and adds extra levels of complexity. When completing challenges and then perusing other answers, I sometimes feel there is not enough clarity over what it is that makes an answer more advanced. There have been some challenges that create a one line function, chaining 5 or more obscure methods at once. I don’t feel the fact that it is on one line makes it advanced if it is not very readable. However, there have been some advanced answers that take different logical approaches and find the solution quickly and elegantly. There are some approaches that open your eyes to further possibilities. One in particular that I saw, changed the problem into a new one that would bear the same result. This can enable you to get around issues with types of variables or methods that you can use.</p>

						<p>Here are the tasks I completed: <a href="https://codepen.io/collection/XzwPqO/">https://codepen.io/collection/XzwPqO/</a></p>

						<p>I have tried to add comments as I progressed to show what my thought process was at this time in my learning. On later projects I also added neater, more elegant solutions I found to the tasks.</p>

						<h3>FCC: Record Collection, js Task (Revision)</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="article clearfix">
						<img class="post-photo" src="Images/RecordJS.jpg" alt="List of accomplished tasks">
						<p>So now that the first certificate is through from <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a>, that means I should start working through the javascript tasks. Two years ago I did start these in their previous setup so it feels like a jump start to know that I have completed most of the basic tests section. I thought it worth challenging myself to try some of the tasks again though to make sure this material had stuck. </p>

						<p>While I had a rough idea of what to do, I needed to look a few things up and was not using the correct syntax. That aside, the lessons I have had so far have taught me how to approach a problem far better than I was initially. First of all, I made new linked html and js files so that I would be able to test my work as I progressed. This made the work so much easier to handle. Before I would attempt to set the whole thing up in one go, then struggle to see where it went wrong when it (inevitably) didn’t work first time. I also attempted to break tasks down into smaller tasks where possible. I started with a simple situation that worked for the most straight forward request a user would have. I made sure it worked and for my benefit on these challenges, commented what I was doing in short statements. This enabled me to get the tasks into 3 key sections and test with ease.</p>

						<p>By having fewer new elements each time and each code chunk being broken into as close to a single task as possible, I was able to test and move through this work in around an hour. Two years ago I am sure it annoyed me, left me wondering what on earth was going wrong and it’s a great relief that this time round I feel that I have made progress in my problem solving skills as well as my knowledge of the programming language.</p>

						<h3>Back Learning in NYC and Earned FCC Responsive Web Design Certificate</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="article clearfix">
						<img class="post-photo" src="Images/fccCert.jpg" alt="FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certificate">
						<p>1 month on and we are finally set in New York City. I forget how long it takes to set up bank accounts and all, especially when you don’t exist on any financial records in the country. This has slowed down the process of learning some what but over the last two days, I have got back into gear and revisited my last project for <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/">learn.freecodecamp.org</a>. It’s hard to run over something again cold and move quickly. I had to read my HTML a couple of times and read up on CSS Grids several times before I began. As it turns out, I was very pleased that I had left my work in a good position before I stopped working on it. Essentially, I had completed all of the HTML to pass the tests set out by FCC (minus the css media query) so coming back to it now, I knew that I would mainly work on CSS with just a few tweaks to the code.</p>

						<p>I spent a lot of time going over tutorials again to try and add CSS Grids to this project as I hadn’t used it in the others. Unfortunately, there wasn’t too much to the site and so I don’t feel that I’ve pushed myself to learn much about it at this attempt. Especially as it needed a fixed sidebar. Being position fixed meant that it is taken out of the regular flow anyway so I basically made a two column grid with nothing in the first one. You can see why I’m underwhelmed. Equally though, I didn’t see a point in making the site unnecessarily	complicated.</p>

						<p>All that said, I have completed the final project of 5 on the Responsive Web Design course and earned my certificate. You can see it here: <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/josephclander/responsive-web-design">www.freecodecamp.org/certification/josephclander/responsive-web-design</a>. While I had two gaps in this course, it has helped me to see how far I have come from the first lessons learning markup, to being able to look at a blank page and create a site. I feel I still need to practice a lot and continue to consolidate my knowledge but this is a big milestone.</p>

						<p>Shortly, my wife and I will be moving over to New York City for her work. Soon to head up the American branch of the company she works for, we have been discussing a way for her to showcase all the things she is doing. Although she is mentioned for her work on her company website, YouTube, Linked-in and Twitter, there isn’t one area that holds all the things she has done together. Knowing she was interested in building a website, I quickly got onto finding her chosen domain name for the best price with best renewal rate. I’ve been lured into great introductory prices before, then been upset to find the renewal price is more than 3 times the initial price annually. Even if you are not sure the website will last, you don’t want to cripple your options.</p>

						<p>There is going to be a lot to discuss and I’m sure my ability might not match up to my wife’s expectations so there is going to be a learning curve. There is also the matter of maintaining the site. I am so far away from being able to create a CMS system, that I will be required to update it manually myself.</p>

						<p>To hold the site I’ve done the initial admin set up work; name bought and linked to my web hosting space, Google tracker added and the holding page is created and a new Git repository set up, knowing to get my gitignore file in order this time!</p>

						<p>So I was trailing through my bookmarks that I had saved a couple of years ago when I started to get interested in coding. Back then I was scavenging the internet for any free materials available and just saving them en masse. I thought I should go back over these and have a clear out. I looked through a few but some of the bigger names are dishing out some good materials that go further than your usual “Hello world!” startups. I scanned through what was available for free on <a href="https://eu.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775">Udacity’s website</a> (there are fully paid up courses too) and saw some lessons on using Git. Now I have followed a few courses on YouTube and other sources that got me up and started, using this very blog in fact, but this has proven to be a more in depth, highly detailed course to get you practiced and is going well so far.</p>
						<p>UPDATE: I have noted that there are quite a few courses on their site for Git. My link takes you to the version that I used.</p>

						<h3>Adding Keyboard Accessibility</h3>

					<div class="article clearfix">
						<img class="post-photo" src="Images/tabkey.jpg" alt="Photo of the tab key on a keyboard">
						<p>As I continue to see more and more articles on improving accessibility I realise that it is not until you start to test your site that you see truly how it feels to navigate with certain restrictions. And how annoying it gets when it just doesn't work!</p>
						<p>Playing with the new faded overlay I added to the bottom of the articles for asthetic purposes, I decided to just use the tab key to navigate the page. Starting from the url, the tab key sent me down the page to the first instance where I have an anchor. Most of the articles are missed and because I added a hidden section that's only revealed on clicking a div element, you can't even open them to read.</p>
						<p>Doing some research, I found that if I stick to the rules of semantic HTML and make my div element a button element, then the tab key will focus on it and simply using enter will expand the selection. I did have to add the style "border: none" to break the user styles again but this feels much better now.</p>
						<p>This doesn't mean the problem is completely solved for keyboard access. Now as you navigate the page, for any articles that you don't open, you will still navigate those links unnecessarily and shift the text in the article down so you can't read the headline. However, an immediate fix isn't required as the tab goes to the expand button first before the links so it's most likely you didn't want to read it in the first place.</p>

						<h3>Book Review: UX for Beginners by Joel Marsh</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="article clearfix">
						<img class="post-photo" src="Images/uxdesign.jpg" alt="UX for Beginners book cover of a rubber duck">
						<p>There were many interesting things that came out of the book for me. I already appreciated that UX was not a means of making a beautiful design but the book had pushed to show that a great deal of thought on psychology goes into the way a UX designer creates a website. A lot of the approaches that caught my attention were looking at how to not just make the sites accessible and intuitive to the user but to make them “feel” like they were making the correct choices. As a web designer, I am to look at what the site’s goals are and what the user’s goals are. I need to make it such that when the user gets their goal, so does the website and it does need to be in that order.</p>

						<p>It was interesting to read about the methods used to grab a user’s attention; gamification, colour schemes, lining up buttons along the “axes of interaction” (or not) and use of dummy prices to give the look of value to name but a few. It made you look at some of your most used sites in a new light as you can now critique them on how they attempt to keep your attention. It also highlighted to you how certain sites are trying to trick you. Hunting to find buttons that have negative actions for the site or the use of click-bait become even more obvious. The book doesn’t focus on exposing the sneaky sites, it gives a good exposure to accessibility features and how your design could be improved to help all too.</p>

						<p>When trying to design, I have now learned that aiming to solve problems that you see in front of you is a better approach than simply brain storming good ideas. This was quite a standout point for me as you do imagine designers just sitting around trying to come up with cool ideas. The approach means that as you discover what the problems or limitations are, you will be able to make sure all are taken note of and that fewer problems are created if at all. This resonated with me from the use of Linear Programming in Mathematics. This looks to form equations of all the issues and graph them. You then look for the areas of the graph that area valid and select the ones that give you the best result from that list.</p>

						<p>The methods used to test your site for effectiveness also have a very mathematical feel to them. I have spent a long time in my profession being told about how the data makes the point the tester wants it too, when in reality it hasn’t been tested fairly. The use of surveys appears almost pointless without leading the users except for a few circumstances where minimal, factual information is required. A/B testing appeals to my science background as they try to use large samples and change only one element. This is what makes a test fair. It also hit home about how people’s memories do not always tell the truth. This applies to both the user and the tester. Use of film to see user’s reactions alongside facts such as the ones you can use with Google’s tools will give a much more accurate picture of what is going on. Again, these must be used as factually as possible and not interpreted.</p>

						<p>There were many more points made in this book worth reading. I have only scratched the surface.</p>

						<p>Oh my god. How hard is it to style a button? I couldn’t believe that no CSS styling would work on the submit button on my form. Every site said that it was easy but I could only get width to make ANY difference. With further research, it appears that the user agent styles were acting strangely for me. To get any of my styles to work I had to change a border that I didn’t need to change. Why is that? Luckily I stumbled across this site <a href="https://css-tricks.com/overriding-default-button-styles/">on overriding default button styles</a>, otherwise I would have assumed that it couldn’t be done, at least not by me.</p>

						<p>And release!</p>

						<p>NOTE: User Agent Styles are the CSS styles that every web browser uses out of the box to style HTML. This means that if you didn’t create any CSS at all to link to your document, that it would still be legible, if still exceedingly dull and awkward.</p>

						<p>While considering the topic, it reminded me that other issues I had were also due to factory settings. For example, it took me quite a while to discover why “margin: 0 auto” on  my body tag, was not centering my container div. On closer inspection the body does not automatically cover 100% of the window and I had assumed it did. It’s completely white and you can’t see it so why not? It turned out my div <em>was</em> centred in the div! So “width: 100%” on the body fixed it. Although I didn’t use the following technique for this issue, I had seen that you can add a single pixel border to objects so that you can see them and understand what they are doing until you are ready to remove them.</p>

						<p>If these styles are becoming a menace and you want full control, there are CSS stylesheets out there that will reset everything to zero such as <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/">Eric Meyer's Reset Tool</a>. There are ups and downs to this. Yes, there will be fewer styles that you are trying to override as you get to build them from scratch but it also means it takes a long time. For a newbie like me, it’s worth looking at the final product to see if you’ve kept the code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) as I may move things just on a visual basis and at the end realise that every paragraph tag has different padding when it truly wasn’t necessary.</p>

						<p>Really noticing the work that the guys at freecodecamp have put into their site over the last two years. I think we have to be very grateful that there are people out there willing to create these opportunities so thanks!</p>

						<p>Re-opening my first challenges helped me to realise that I have gained a better working knowledge of web development and that it isn’t quite so scary anymore. Things just look more do-able.</p> 

						<p>I’m looking forward to putting more of what I’ve learned into practice and starting from a blank screen again. If I feel I have time it maybe worth refactoring my code for the first challenges. I understand this is a more realistic daily life of a developer and fixing bad ideas. So I better get on to fixing my bad ones.</p>

						<h3>Learning about Accessibility</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="article clearfix">
						<img class="post-photo" src="Images/access.jpg" alt="Curriculum from Free Code Camp">
						<p>Reading the <a href="learn.freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</a> curriculum made me realise the importance of accessibility and that I will have to consider it in my markup more closely. I was aware from previous classes that you needed to consider this but it showed that running over previously visited material is beneficial. For example, I knew that I should add alt tags to images to help those with screen readers but what I didn’t realise is that if I used anything as a decoration and gave it an alt tag such as “long black line”, I would just be littering the screen with nonsense as far as a screen reader was concerned.</p>

						<p>I also thought little of seeing the semantic tags for main and nav introduced. Now I’m more aware that this helps tell the story of where elements are and their function. Not to mention my use of ‘h’ tags! So I now understand that I shouldn’t have more than one h1 tag as it wouldn’t really make sense to have more than one main headline/title would it?</p>

						<p>All this had made me think that beauty isn’t skin deep and I am going to need to try and make sure my markup looks good on the inside as well.</p>

						<p>There are a few that I hadn’t heard of though and it made me wonder how much they were used. The ‘time’ tag is definitely a new one to me. I decided to look this up a bit and found an article on the ever useful site of <a href="https://css-tricks.com/time-element/">CSS Tricks</a>.</p>

						<h3>Completing online courses</h3>

					<div class="article clearfix">
						<img class="post-photo" src="Images/fcc.jpg" alt="Free Code Camp Site">
						<p>So this week has been busy and difficult to get through as many lessons as I would have liked to. However, I completed the few remaining lessons on <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">flatironschool.com</a> and it inspired me to look up more videos on the use of jQuery. It has led me to try out collapsible sections in my articles that work a little better than with the target selector. For future reference I placed my work in <a href="https://codepen.io/tidyjoe/pen/YvxaqK">Codepen</a> so that I can remind myself or use it as a component for future work. I have spelled out the issues I had in implementing it and where I could take it further there.</p>

						<p>I have now placed it onto my site in the updated form and am reasonably happy with it. Feeling like I’m writing a school science report, I would say that, if I were to try this again I would like to find a way to blur the text at the bottom of the page as it appears as if it has been cut off. I wasn’t able to successfully  do this with an inset box-shadow because I have a background colour (I think) which makes me think that I would need to add a div that also transitions on selection.</p>

						<p>It feels bitter sweet to have finished all the labs on javaScript. While I liked the difficulty of the challenges, I mostly spent my time trying to figure out if issues occurred in my code because of a written error or a misunderstanding of the way the test had to be submitted, which wasn’t always consistent. This could double the amount of time spent on a challenge and obviously add greatly to self doubt. I imagine if I were working in a team, these would be issues that you would quickly communicate and solve.</p>

						<p>I’m not ready to move onto the Ruby part of the induction and want to play with frontend a little more. I am going to head back to <a href="learn.freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</a> that I first completed some lessons for over two years ago. It looks like the site has been updated and looks pretty swish and it has a structured certification too.</p>

						<p>So I started to consider the fact that my posts are getting longer here as the content is becoming more complex. I am concerned that it will become boring to look back on but for the moment I'll just settle for a way to hide some of the content until I'm ready to read it.</p>
						<p>Rather than try it out on the site directly, I have been experimenting in <a href="https://codepen.io/tidyjoe/pen/bKRLop">Codepen</a> to see what the effect would be. You can check it out but I see that my next module on the Flatiron Bootcamp is all on jQuery. The little experience I've had of this tells me that a far smoother and more elegant solution is just around the corner.</p>
						<p>I am starting to create these more often and try to document them so that I can refer back to them later.</p>

						<h3>Changing how I consider success</h3>

					<div class="article clearfix">
						<img class="post-photo" src="Images/JavaScriptLearn.jpg" alt="Flatiron Online Bootcamp Photo">
						<p>During this week I managed to complete another module of the JavaScript section of the <a href="https://learn.co/tracks/bootcamp-prep">Flatiron School Bootcamp Prep</a>. Whilst a lot of the material is straight forward with a few examples, there are parts of JavaScript that took me a while to comprehend. Namely, "callbacks".</p>
						<p>After reading the material on the website, there were links for further resources and I found myself falling down a wormhole, as one article led to a little more understanding, followed by further mystery. As it turned out, the coding challenges didn't require callbacks but with over 3 hours of study on them, I was putting them in!</p>
						<p>For a second time I found myself completing a challenge at a reasonable pace until one part left me clueless. Now, the challenge worked in my browser, but I've already seen enough memes to know that it doesn't mean it works in the way it's supposed to and I didn't want to be that guy. After an extra hour on the help forum, I find out that to pass the written tests, all sections had to be within a given function and a 3s cut and paste job let it pass. one part of me was still fuming but I'm beginning to teach myself how to measure success.</p>
						<p>The journey helped me learn that I cannot check one array against another with just the "===" operator. Reading questions more carefully for technical details is essential and by talking with technical support, realised that I've learned more and at the same time realised that there is yet more again added to the list of things I need to learn.</p>

						<p>So after a full day of working one section at a time I have successfully managed to get the website ready for hosting. I had to show a lot of restraint to not start fire fighting as I saw other sections of my website out of line while I was progressing. The footer had not been touched since the start and at one point sat up above the header but I saw features through to a reasonable close that would only need fine touches.</p>
						<p>I am sure I will update this site and could go back to refactor it but it will be a decent enough layout to help me track my progression.</p>

						<img class="post-photo" src="Images/newheader.jpg" alt="Updated header photo">
						<p>Since my last post I have mainly been trying to figure out how to structure content for my <a href="http://whatcanicookwiththat.com/" target="_blank">whatcanicookwiththat.com</a> website. I'm finding it hard to be able to create something that looks good before I add code. I had a general idea that I wanted to create a splash page but was unsure how this would take shape after. After I spent the best part of an hour trying to take photos of the inside of my fridge from different angles, I settled on a few choice photos so that I could work for desktop and eventually, mobile. The general shape was quick but then came hours of shifting until I came up with the idea of the text coming in the form of a mobile phone conversation. I found that when I had the plan, it was a lot simpler to be able to break up the idea into sections and construct it. Yes there were errors but I knew where to head.</p>
						<p>I have created a minimum product that I am happy with but knew I needed to create content for further pages other wise it lacked real content and may cause confusion if I make it live. This is where I have had to stop for now.</p>
						<p>Now to work on this blog page. As it stands we have a scrolling background (with ugly blue leather photo of low quality) and a better looking header than I started with. That's it for now. Trying to force myself to tackle one feature at a time before commiting it to Git. Hard but I'm sure it'll pay off in the long run. Also learned that inset box-shadow does not work on images.</p>

						<p>A lot has gone through my mind with how to continue to learn to code and in what direction to go. I have now completed a lot of online courses that hold your hand through projects but I feel unsatisfied that I don't have the experience of building those things myself from the blank screen.</p>
						<p>Currently I am completing the FlatIron School's bootcamp prep course and it has covered a lot of material I have seen before but has been a good reminder, having had almost 2 years away from seriously attempting javascript. Another good reminder was the MIMO app for iPhone. Coding on a phone isn't really a thing but they manage to run through tutorials that are helpful.</p>
						<p>This all brought me to the conclusion that I needed to experience making something from scratch again so have opened two sites; <a href="https://www.josephclander.com/" target="_blank">www.josephclander.com</a> and <a href="http://whatcanicookwiththat.com/" target="_blank">www.whatcanicookwiththat.com</a>. I can continue to write about my progress and keep a place for the things that I make. Also in my spare time I love to cook and often talk about it on my instagram feed. I'm doing it so much now though that I feel I can make a dedicated channel to it with the tag name #whatcanicookwiththat where I show how to make meals from the last few remanants you find in the bottom of your fridge.</p>
						<p>I've aquired the sites and domains and am now working through the research for how I want these sites to look.</p>
