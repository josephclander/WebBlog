# webBlog - Joseph C Lander: Learning to Code
A simple blog to note my progress and practice use of git.

## The idea

Do I have a lot to say about myself, am I a writer? No. Here is an excuse to practise creating a website and playing with as many features of deploying it as my journey allows. I am following a myriad of online courses and classes as well as reading articles and books on top of attending meetups and following people in the industry on social media. All of these resources have led to what you see here so far.

This site is as much for me, as a journal, as it is for any body else to see my progression. I comment on things I am learning and those areas that I get stuck on. As I come across inspiration and features that I meet on sites elsewhere, I try to include them in this site on a gradual basis. Somethings turn out to be beyond my current level at the time but they help me to see where I'm going. In time these ideas becoming easier to imagine and are added.
